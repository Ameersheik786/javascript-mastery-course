## Beginner Project – Level 2

### **Traffic Light Controller (Visual Logic Project)**

---

## 👋 Introduction (Encouraging)

This project is made **especially for beginners**.

You don’t need to worry about:

- Complex JavaScript
- Advanced logic
- Perfect UI

This project helps you **see JavaScript working visually**, which makes learning easier 😊

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

Create a **traffic light simulation** where:

- Red, Yellow, and Green lights are shown
- Clicking a button changes the active light

This kind of logic is used in:

- Simulations
- UI state control
- Simple system logic

---

## 🛠 Technologies to Use

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (**if / else only**)

---

## 📌 What You Need to Build

### 1️⃣ HTML Part

Create:

- A container for traffic light
- Three circles:

  - Red
  - Yellow
  - Green

- One button:

  - **Change Signal**

💡 **Hint:**
Each light can be a `<div>`.

---

### 2️⃣ CSS Part

Style the lights:

- Circle shape
- Default color: gray
- When active:

  - Red → red
  - Yellow → yellow
  - Green → green

💡 **Hint:**
Use `border-radius: 50%`.

---

### 3️⃣ JavaScript Logic (Very Simple)

#### What the Button Should Do:

- On first click → Red ON
- On second click → Yellow ON
- On third click → Green ON
- Then repeat

#### JavaScript Rules:

- Use only:

  - `if`
  - `else if`
  - `else`

- Change colors using `style.backgroundColor`

💡 **Hint (Very Important):**
You can use **one variable** like `currentLight`.

## 🧠 How to Think (Beginner Friendly)

Don’t try to do everything at once.

1. First, make circles
2. Then color one circle
3. Then change color on click
4. Then add if/else logic

That’s it 👍

## ❌ Restrictions

- ❌ No loops
- ❌ No arrays
- ❌ No timers (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`)
- ❌ No advanced JavaScript

---

## ⏱ Estimated Time

**2–3 hours**

## ✅ What You Will Learn

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand conditions (`if / else`)
- Learn DOM manipulation
- Gain confidence seeing visual output
- Build logic step by step 🌱

## 🌟 Encouragement for Students

If your light changes color —
🎉 **Congratulations!**
That means your JavaScript is working.

Don’t compare your speed with others.
Learning slowly is still learning ❤️
